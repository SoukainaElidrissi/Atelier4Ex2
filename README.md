# GANs for Abstract Art Generation 

## 1. Introduction:

This repository contains the code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate abstract art images. The dataset used for training is sourced from the [Abstract Art Gallery on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery).

## 2. Files Included:

- `generator.py`: Defines the architecture and forward pass of the generator network.
- `discriminator.py`: Defines the architecture and forward pass of the discriminator network.
- `losses.py`: Defines the loss functions used for training the GAN.
- `train.py`: Main script for training the GAN model.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for setting up data loaders, plotting, etc.

## 3. Setup:

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/abstract-art-gan.git
## Summary
This synthesis outlines the steps to implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating abstract art using PyTorch. It covers model definition, training, evaluation, and the generation of new data for comparison. Monitoring losses and assessing the quality of generated images are essential steps in the GAN training process.
