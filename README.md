# GANs for Abstract Art Generation 

## 1. Introduction:

This repository contains the code for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate abstract art images. The dataset used for training is sourced from the [Abstract Art Gallery on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery).

## 2. Files Included:

- `generator.py`: Defines the architecture and forward pass of the generator network.
- `discriminator.py`: Defines the architecture and forward pass of the discriminator network.
- `losses.py`: Defines the loss functions used for training the GAN.
- `train.py`: Main script for training the GAN model.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions for setting up data loaders, plotting, etc.

## 3. Setup:

- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/abstract-art-gan.git
